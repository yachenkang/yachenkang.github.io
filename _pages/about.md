I am Yachen Kang (亢雅宸 in Chinese). I am a joint Ph.D. student of [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by Dr. Donglin Wang. Also, I am a member of [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) in Westlake University, where I do my research work on machine learning and robot learning.

Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my bachelor’s degree of Engineering from [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/ese_en/main.htm), [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/EN), majoring in Biomedical Engineering.
